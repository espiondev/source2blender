Full Guide of Method
""""""""""""""""""""

| It's amazing how simple SourceIO has made it. First install `SourceIO <https://github.com/REDxEYE/SourceIO>`_ as an Add-on into Blender. The steps for this can be found at the :ref:`installingprograms` Section. Once done, open Blender, click :guilabel:`File` > :guilabel:`â¤“ Import` > :guilabel:`Source Engine Assets` > :guilabel:`Source model (.mdl)`, and choose the ``.MDL`` file you're after inside the ``Models`` folder. The ``Models`` folder can be found inside any of the directories within the ``[sfm_directory] / game`` folders. It should have textures set up and everything. Workshop items and mods can be found under ``[sfm_directory] / game / workshop``, and the ``MDL`` files should be in the ``Models`` folder.

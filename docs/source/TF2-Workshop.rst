Team Fortress 2 Workshop
========================

| The TF2 workshop is a bit complicated. Unlike other Workshops, such as that of Garry's Mod or Source Filmmaker, only Maps can be Subscribed to. Other Workshop uploads are only for displaying pictures or videos, and for VALVe to view.
| The good news is, with an official VALVe program called SteamCMD, you **CAN** get some TF2 workshop items.
| The bad news is, only the items that have actually been Accepted can be obtained. All maps, and Accepted items, are the only ones that can be gotten. Otherwise your best chances for getting the model are to contact the maker of it on your own.

| If you know how to use SteamCMD then this shouldn't be a problem. Otherwise, I recommend  `This Youtube Video <https://youtu.be/fxFX9uamHvI>`_ that explains how to use it. Maps work completely fine and you can Subscribe to them. Everything else, is where it gets complicated.

Maps and included props
-----------------------

| The process of importing TF2 workshop maps is **exactly** the same as that of :ref:`tf2_vanilla`'s :ref:`tf2_v_map` section. There are two methods to do so, both are explained there. The only thing to know about, is that if a Map is obtained by Subscribing to it from the TF2 Workshop on Steam, it will be saved to ``Steamapps / workshop / content / 440``. There will be multiple folders in this location, one of them holds the map. You'll have to do a bit of searching for it, but the ``.BSP`` file has a proper name. From this location, copy the ``.BSP`` file into ``[game_directory] / tf / maps``. Then the process to bring it into Blender is exactly the same, and instructions are provided on :ref:`tf2_vanilla`'s :ref:`tf2_v_map` section.
| If instead you obtained the map file by a download on a mod site such as Gamebanana or through downloading it from a workshop downloader such as the one built in Crowbar, the one available `Online <https://steamworkshopdownloader.io/>`_, or through SteamCMD, then just move it from wherever you downloaded, to ``[game_directory] / tf / maps``. After that, the process is exactly the same, and you should follow the steps listed on the :ref:`tf2_vanilla` section.

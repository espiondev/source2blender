Maps and included props
-----------------------

| The process of importing TF2 workshop maps is **exactly** the same as that of TF2 Vanilla Maps. There are two methods to do so, both are explained in that section. The only thing to know about, is that if a Map is obtained by Subscribing to it from the TF2 Workshop on Steam, it will be saved to ``Steamapps / workshop / content / 440``. There will be multiple folders in this location, one of them holds the map. You'll have to do a bit of searching for it, but the ``.BSP`` file has a proper name. From this location, copy the ``.BSP`` file into ``[game_directory] / tf / maps``. Then the process to bring it into Blender is exactly the same, and instructions are provided on the TF2-Vanilla section.
| If instead you obtained the map file by a download on a mod site such as Gamebanana or through downloading it from a workshop downloader such as the one built in Crowbar, the one available `Online <https://steamworkshopdownloader.io/>`_, or through SteamCMD, then just move it from wherever you downloaded, to ``[game_directory] / tf / maps``. After that, the process is exactly the same, and you should follow the steps listed on the :ref:`TF2-Vanilla:tf2_vanilla` section.

Quickstart
==========
This page covers useful add-ons made by Hisanimations that streamlines importing certain Source engine assets to Blender.

The TF2 Trifecta
----------------
| Importing characters and cosmetics has been simplified by `Hisanimations' <https://github.com/hisprofile>'`_ Blender add-on, the **`TF2 Trifecta <https://github.com/hisprofile/TF2-Trifecta>`_**. This add-on has numerous useful features, such as:
* Importing mercenaries in either IK (easier for general animation and posing) or FK (compatible with importing animations).
* Searching for cosmetics and automatically parenting them to a selected mercenary.
* Updating the Blender files that contain cosmetics, mercenaries, and props to the latest version.
* Applying paints to cosmetics, fixing broken cosmetic materials (* `See here <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i0ibU40iceU>`_ *).

| The YouTube tutorial for the trifecta can be found **`here <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nV9Mj5QEaPg>`_**. The original TF2 Collection tutorial can be found **`here <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0DMz-n1LSII>`_**.

The Buildings port
------------------
| `Hisanimations <https://github.com/hisprofile>'`_ has made a buildings port, including a fully-functional sentry, dispenser, and teleporters (`*See here* <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uN2vqnkHqFk>`_).

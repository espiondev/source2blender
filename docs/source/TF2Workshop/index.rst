Team Fortress 2 Workshop
========================

| The TF2 workshop is slightly complicated. Unlike other Workshops, such as that of Garry's Mod or Source Filmmaker, only Maps can be Subscribed to. Other Workshop uploads are only for displaying pictures or videos, and for VALVe to view.
| The good news is, with an official VALVe program called SteamCMD, you can get some TF2 workshop items.
| The bad news is, only the items that have actually been Accepted can be obtained. All maps, and Accepted items, are the only ones that can be downloaded. Otherwise, your best chance for obtaining the model would be to contact their original creators.

| If you know how to use SteamCMD then this shouldn't be a problem. Otherwise, we recommend  `This Youtube Video <https://youtu.be/fxFX9uamHvI>`_ (*Downloading Steam Workshop Files - 2022 edition* by Open3DLab) that explains how to use it. Maps work completely fine and you can Subscribe to them. Everything else is where it gets somewhat arduous.
